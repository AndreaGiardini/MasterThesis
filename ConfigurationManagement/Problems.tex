\section{Problems}

\subsection{Multiple service managers}

The current Puppet setup is not a traditional one since at CERN there are
several service managers maintaining different infrastructures but using
the same modules. Since most of the modules are shared across multiple
services we need to make sure that every change to those modules doesn't
affect others people using the same code.

\subsection{Deployment interval}



\subsection{Configuration and package drifts}

Managing such a large number of machines has his drawbacks in terms of
management. Even with the use of Puppet, MCollective and other tools to
manage large number of machines it is not easy to keep track of the status
of all of them.

It happens in fact that some machines are found in a state they are not
supposed to be, usually because there are other failures that prevent
Puppet from doing his job. This can have different causes that, most of
the time, require manual intervention.

What is difficult to do is spot those machines among all the others due to
the large number.
