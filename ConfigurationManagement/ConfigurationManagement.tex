After describing the infrastructure of CERN data centres we will focus
more on the main subject of this thesis: Configuration Management. The
following chapter will explain in detail what Configuration Management is,
how the infrastructure works and how it is maintained by the team.

We will start by describing the infrastructure and the clusters that are
part of it, what is their role and how they work. Successively we will
give an overview of how resources are managed in the data centre and how
to organize servers in different modules, hostgroups and environments.
Concluding, we will highlight the current problems of the infrastructure,
focusing on configuration and package drifting which will be analysed in
deep.
