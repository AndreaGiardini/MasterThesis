\section{Infrastructure Drifts}

We define as Infrastructure Drift the tendency of one or more machine to
have a different configuration compared with the majority of the cluster.
This behaviour, if not detected, might lead to dangerous and unpredictable
behaviours.

A drift can have different causes and it is not always easy to detect and
address, usually a manual intervention in required to solve the problem.
During the internship multiple causes have been detected, their causes are
discussed in the following sections.

\subsection{Package Drifts}

A package drift happens when a machine in a cluster has different packages
compared to another, or a different version of the installed packages.
When this happens the risk is to have a cluster serving requests with two
different versions of the same software.

\subsection{Configuration Drifts}
