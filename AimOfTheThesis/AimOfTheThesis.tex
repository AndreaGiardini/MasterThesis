Managing computer infrastructures in a efficient way has been, since ever,
one of the major problems in the world of Information Technology. When the
scale of the deployment grows it starts to be difficult to organize and
manage efficiently all the resources. Moreover, fixing or preventing
issues is a difficult task to accomplish since it is usually not easy to
detect and understand where the problem is.

This thesis outlines the results of one year of work at the IT Department
of CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The aim of this
work has been to analyse and study how to detect and prevent the most
common issues in large computing infrastructures: configuration and
package drifts. After a deep study of the infrastructure and the issues
affecting it, we proposed two software solutions in order to limit these
problems. This document describes in detail the results of these studies
and how we planned to solve these problems.
