\section{Current Status}

Before deploying Package Inventory and the continuous integration platform
to production we ran extensive tests in order to prevent every possible
error to come up once shipped. This process has been proved to be
efficient and gave us good results. In particular, for Package Inventory,
we started deploying the software in small sets of machines at the same
time and tested the results for weeks. It is obviously difficult to
predict all the possible problems, especially at this scale: in fact, most
of the issues we re related to the scalability of the whole process.

The deployment of the continuous integration platform has been planned
together with the migration of the Git backend from gitolite to Gitlab.
Since the gitolite service was basically end of life it has been decided
not to support it and to focus on the Gitlab platform. Some test
repositories and test tickets have been created in order not to interfere
with the production repositories and platforms.

As of today, both Package Inventory and the continuous integration
platform are available for service managers and users. Documentation and
guides have been written in order to invite users to test both services
and provide feedbacks and suggestions to the configuration team.
