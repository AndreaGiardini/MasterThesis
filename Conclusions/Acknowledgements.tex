Today, a three year long trip comes to conclusion.

It has been a hard one, with lot of ups and downs, but I finally made it.
It is useless to say that I would not have made it without the support of
all the people that helped me during this amazing journey.

First of all, I want to thank my parents and my family for supporting my
studies and my education. They have been of great support and help during
all those years and I could not have made it without their help.

I would like to acknowledge all the Configuration Team at CERN: Ben,
Alberto, Nacho, Akos, Jerome, Ulrich, Gavin, Steve, Ignacio, Fernando,
Lorena, Iain and Paolo. They supported my projects and ideas all the time,
giving me opportunity to be really part of the team and not a simple
student.

A huge standout goes also to the house of Emilia Noyeres: to Adrian,
Radoslav, Aimilianos, Bruno, Adrian, Cristina and Niki. My time in Geneva
would not have been the same without the group of friends that you have
been for me. Thank you for all the moments we spent together, I will never
forget them.

Thank you to my oldest friends: Paolo, Nicola, Luca, Lorenzo, Giacomo and
Giulio. Even if we do not manage to see each other often, when we meet is
like the first time.

Thanks to all the people that I met during this amazing journey: you made
my life special, filling it with new experiences and a strong friendship.
This trip would not have been the same without you.

Last, but not least, thanks to Fanny for her support during this last
year. Your words helped me when I thought that I could not make it. It has
been a long and stressful year for us, I am glad we made it through.
