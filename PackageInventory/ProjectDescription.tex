\section{Project Description}

Following the growing number of machines installed in the datacentres,
a solution for managing package drifts was needed. In the last years more
and more problems have been detected generated by configuration and
package drifting.

In particular outdated machines are always difficult to spot, and often
happens that a set of machines are not aligned to the configuration due to
local problems. This may obviously lead to different and unexpected
behaviours.

Moreover this situation may introduce security issues. Every time a new
vulnerabily is release we want to make sure that all the systems applied
the patch correctly.

For this reason, in collaboration with the PES team, I developed
PackageInventory: a set of tools to query the status of packages across
multiple hosts. It has three main elements:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Reporter
  \item Cli
  \item ElasticSearch Cluster
\end{itemize}

The first two elements have been developed from scratch while the
ElasticSearch server is used by the configuration team also to run other
services.
