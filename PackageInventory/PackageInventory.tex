This chapter will be dedicated to describe Package Inventory: the first
main project of this thesis aimed to detect and limit the problem of
package drifting. We will analyse in this chapter the idea behind the
project and the process that made it an useful tool for debugging issues.

After some example on its usage we also reported some occasions in which
Package Inventory managed to solve issues and find misalignment in the
servers configuration.
