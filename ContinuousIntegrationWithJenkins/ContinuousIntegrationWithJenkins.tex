This chapter describes in detail the second main project of this thesis,
aimed to automate the deployment of configuration changes. Even this
project is obviously related to the problems of the infrastructure that
have been highlighted in the previous chapters. In particular we are
trying to automate the deployment of configuration changes, trying to
remove any manual intervention.

We will start describing the aim of the project: what are we trying to
solve and how we are planning to do it. Successively we will analyse
deeply how the work flows have been organized, which use cases we found
and how our project influenced them. We concluded the chapter with some
results about the project realised and future opportunities for additional
development.
