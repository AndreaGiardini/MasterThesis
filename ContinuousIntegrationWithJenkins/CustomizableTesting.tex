\section{Customizable Testing}

As we said in the previous sections, the idea is to have a set of tests
customizable for every Puppet module. In order to do this a new folder has
been introduced in \textit{code/manifests/tests}.

This folder contains all the tests and the configuration files that the
user can modify to customize his experience.

This folder, after his initialization, contains four files:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{check.pp} - Contains the Puppet manifest of the machine that we want to test
  \item \textit{run\_tests.sh} - A scripts to trigger tests inside the machine
  \item \textit{run\_tests\_external.sh} - A script to trigger tests outside the machine
  \item \textit{config.sh} - Contains some variables to customize the testing
\end{itemize}
